This app can be used for furniture stores as their e-commerce app. The design of this app is so elegant and neat clean and gives the best user experience to the user. We have also added #Flutter #Animation in this design which improvises the overall experience. Go through the code of this #FurnitureApp and I am sure it will help you to learn a lot.

On our Furniture app, #UI has three pages one for the main screen page which has tabs for different categories then a list of our products in each category. The second screen is for a particular category page and the third screen is for the product page.
